## The Codex Vitae of Amanda Bahraini
A thorough notes about what I think about, what makes me think about it in the first place, and what I do about it. Should anybody want to make a robot version of me, or a clone of me, or a proxy of me, this is the ultimate cheat sheets ;)

## Focus
My brain, just like everyone else's, scans and retrieves particular information from my surrounding. These are random things, words and field of studies, that hold my interest.

## Personality
> A clown class, I love making people laugh with my (mostly) self-deprecating jokes
> I prefer my hair tangled and messy. It reminds me of my beloved late grandmother (from my father side). I love so many things about my grandma, her curly hair-bun is one of my favorites.
> I don't like wearing wristwatch, bangle, short necklace, earrings, ring, and similar items. I can't focus when I'm wearing one (I could tolerate the long necklace though, I have several of those things). As an illustrator (or someone who loves to do illustration) I prefer my hands free from all of those things, including long nails. I always keep my nails short, and I don't wear nail polish--I still find it meaningless.
> I can't stand strong fragrance. I only have one kind of perfume (my sister bought it for me years ago), which still intact today. I only wear it (one mild spray!) when I'm going to important meeting with client, a marriage ceremony, or dates =)). If I have to go to the hair saloon to cut my hair, I will have to bring my own shampoo, or I will have to rewash my hair by myself later when I'm home because I can't stand the smell of unfamiliar shampoo fragrance. It makes me dizzy and grumpy.
> I could tolerate lipstick and blush, I could not understand fake eyelashes, foundation, and contouring. Leave my nose alone.
> I love the facial hair in my legs and hands. Why waxing it?
? I hate zumba, but I love aerobics. I take aerobic class as a chance to train my memory and kinesthetic skill. Zumba and its ever-changing music and movements makes me mad.
> I don't talk in gym. I go fully anti-social at the gym. I don't go there to talk with someone, I want to be sweaty and feel healthy. I want to read my book or listen to my music when I'm burning my fats off. Talk to me later.

## Relationship
I think the best way to love a person is to love him/her as a human (or as what it is, since maybe the object of one's affection and lust isn't always a human, it could be a thing, or a concept). A human, who's prone to mistake, most of the time don't really know what he's/she's saying, and have a tendency to search for his/her own pleasures. I don't think we should spend our time ensuring loyalty and monogamy, or if one lives in a community where poligamy and adulterous act are appreciated, I don't think we should live for that too. I think we should find a way to free ourselves from our ego and care about a person unconditionally. I think the best way to reach that is to vision the kind of thing your significant other would do in several different cases and what you should do about it in order to achieve your goal (let's say your goal is to be with him forever and eever)

## Defined
I use several tools to help me (and others) understand myself. Here's my personal opinion about myself, and also the list and results of all the personality tests that I've taken, down to the horoscope and chinese zodiac ;)
> Always a child at heart, I do think that I'm suffered from a mild version of Peter-Pan syndrome. Growing up sucks.
> I have anxiety disorder.
> MBTI Test: Once an ENFP (2005?), then an INFP (2010?), and now I am a proud INFJ (since 2015 if I'm not mistaken). According to mypersonality.info, I am 95% introvert, 84% intuitive, 58% Feeling, and 58% Judging, and I am more on the turbulence side, so I'm an INFJ-T ;).
> Also, according to mypersonality.info, my 5 top personal intelligences are Musical (85 - but I'm not a musician, maybe I should become one), Logical (75), Intrapersonal (75), Visual (70) and Linguistic (65).
> 4-Personalities test: Once a Sanguine-Plegmatic (2004), not interested in re-taking the test, because I do think that MBTI is more accurate at this kind of thing.
> My IQ test results varied from 124, 127, 128 and 131. I think my last IQ test is in 2004 (before I got into the university).
> Born in August 15th, 1986, I'm a lioness at heart (a leo, that also means I bestow the fire element in my soul - that's what they said) and I also born in the chinese year of the Fire Tiger. I am a canine in fire (that sounds wrong). I do love grilled meat, though, maybe that's why? ;)
