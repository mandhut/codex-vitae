# The Codex Vitae of Amanda Bahraini
A thorough notes about what I think about, what makes me think about it in the first place, and what I do about it. Should anybody want to make a robot version of me, or a clone of me, or a proxy of me, this is the ultimate cheat sheets ;)

# Project
- Since 2018, I have been trying to appreciate people around me more by telling them exactly what makes me respect/like them in the first place. Something specific like, "I appreciate how you're always answering my question with a thorough, detailed, and kind answer.", "I see how you're always taking care of people around you and how you're always remembering the first time/moment you meet them, what they said at that time, what they did.", "I admire how you're always trying to be professional, always striving to do your best, paying attention to your linkedin network and profile.". I know people don't usually say those kind of things in real life, not because they don't want to, but most of the times, because they forget to do so, or maybe because they're afraid people would find them weird, or creepy. I want them to know what a little bravery could do for their life and other people's life. A little appreciation goes a long way.
- I should really publish a book this year (2019). Self-publish is fine, but I need to produce something. :(

# Mantra
Words and statements I rephrase in my mind and tell myself every day.
- Epistemological Modesty is the mantra.
- I appreciate skill, logic, and kindness. Everything else except those 3 things is blurry to me.
- Ask more, judge less.
- In terms of depression, from the book "It's kind of a Funny Story" by Ned Vizzini: life isn't cured. life is managed.
- The quality you see in people around you, good/bad, most likely are the quality that you hate/like about yourself.

# Tips
- Listen to people's story, rephrase their words so they know you're listening, but open your mind for something they don't say. Those unsaid words reveals everything. Learn about microexpression, it's more effective than listening to human's words.
- Humans think they know about themselves, but they really are know nothing. Including us. There's no use in putting so much hope in their promises, there's no use in trying to make promises. Thank them for making the efforts, but don't see too much into it. Be kind and let them make mistakes. And if you like them enough, forgive their mishaps and keep them by your side. 
- Everything changes. People change. You change. Your environment changes. Memories fade. Health deteriorates. Relationship breaks. But on the other hand, something else blooms when another thing dies, death is necessary for something else to born into this world, for someone to grow, to learn new things. So instead of thinking too much about what you should do to preserve everything you have right now, try to enjoy the present moment instead. Don't let your fear of the unknown future and painful past prevent you from enjoying this little time that you have.
- Begging and fretting get you nowhere. Take charge of your own life, catch your own dreams.
- Assume that good and evil exist, we are all both good and evil. There are no such thing as all-good person and all-evil person. We need those two to survice. Embrace your not-so-saint side. Talk with your demon, be friend with it. Remember Naruto and his kyuubi (ok. this sounds childish). Your demon is part of you, it's the embodiment of your anger, your sadness, your sorrow, and your pain. Learn how to cooperate with it, listen to its demands, know when it triggered, and build your life around it. Don't hate it. Embrace it. Admit that the demon exists within you.
- When making a big decision, give 4 months to think before actually decide anything. Let most of your brain cells rebuilt, let your body flush out all the bad stuffs, toxic and maybe imbalance hormones, and think again. 
- When trying to forget someone, heal a severe broken heart, build a new self, give yourself a solid 7 years timeline.
- If you can't feel content of being alone with yourself, you should never blame others for not being able to make you content/happy.
- Stop trying to think that the goal of a relationship (whether is a friendship or romantic ones) is to fill an empty spot in your heart, try to fill other's instead. It's much easier that way.
- You can't share an empty cup. If you want to make someone else happy, you should prepare yourself first.
- The best way to learn something is to let yourself feel stupid and vulnerable about it. You can't learn unless you admit that you know nothing about it.
- Social conventions and norms are boring and most of the times, toxic. Try to indulge people with it but don't let yourself be burdened by it.
- You are what you eat. Read about the death cause of Ernest Hemingway.
- E-book before paperback.

# Personality
> A clown class, I love making people laugh with my (mostly) self-deprecating jokes
> I prefer my hair tangled and messy. It reminds me of my beloved late grandmother (from my father side). I love so many things about my grandma, her curly hair-bun is one of my favorites.
> I don't like wearing wristwatch, bangle, short necklace, earrings, ring, and similar items. I can't focus when I'm wearing one (I could tolerate the long necklace though, I have several of those things). As an illustrator (or someone who loves to do illustration) I prefer my hands free from all of those things, including long nails. I always keep my nails short, and I don't wear nail polish--I still find it meaningless.
> I can't stand strong fragrance. I only have one kind of perfume (my sister bought it for me years ago), which still intact today. I only wear it (one mild spray!) when I'm going to important meeting with client, a marriage ceremony, or dates =)). If I have to go to the hair saloon to cut my hair, I will have to bring my own shampoo, or I will have to rewash my hair by myself later when I'm home because I can't stand the smell of unfamiliar shampoo fragrance. It makes me dizzy and grumpy.
> I could tolerate lipstick and blush, I could not understand fake eyelashes, foundation, and contouring. Leave my nose alone.
> I love the facial hair in my legs and hands. Why waxing it?
? I hate zumba, but I love aerobics. I take aerobic class as a chance to train my memory and kinesthetic skill. Zumba and its ever-changing music and movements make me mad.
> I don't talk in gym. I go fully anti-social at the gym. I don't go there to talk with someone, I want to be sweaty and feel healthy. I want to read my book or listen to my music when I'm burning my fats off. Talk to me later.

# Why?

# Defined
I use several tools to help me (and others) understand myself. Here's my personal opinion about myself, and also the list and results of all the personality tests that I've taken, down to the horoscope and chinese zodiac ;)
- Always a child at heart, I do think that I'm suffered from a mild version of Peter-Pan syndrome. Growing up sucks. Paying bills sucks.
- I have anxiety disorder, I build my life around it, prepare myself for it, so I could retract and rejuvenate whenever the panic hits.
- MBTI Test: Once an ENFP (2005?), then an INFP (2010?), and now I am a proud INFJ (since 2015 if I'm not mistaken). According to mypersonality.info, I am 95% introvert, 84% intuitive, 58% Feeling, and 58% Judging, and I am more on the turbulence side, so I'm an INFJ-T ;).
- I'm a sapiosexual and demisexual. Sapiodemisexual? 
- Also, according to mypersonality.info, my 5 top personal intelligences are Musical (85 - but I'm not a musician, maybe I should become one), Logical (75), Intrapersonal (75), Visual (70) and Linguistic (65).
- 4-Personalities test: Once a Sanguine-Plegmatic (2004), not interested in re-taking the test.
- My IQ test results varied from 124, 127, 128 and 131. I think my last IQ test is in 2004 (before I got into the university).
- Born in August 15th, 1986, I'm a lioness at heart (a leo, that also means I bestow the fire element in my soul - that's what they said) and I also born in the chinese year of the Fire Tiger. I am a canine in fire (that sounds wrong). I do love grilled meat, though, maybe that's why? ;)
