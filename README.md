# The Codex Vitae of Amanda Bahraini
A thorough notes about what I think about, what makes me think about it in the first place, and what I do about it. Should anybody want to make a robot version of me, or a clone of me, or a proxy of me, this is the ultimate cheat sheets ;)

Self-centered, I am. Prepare yourself.

# Project
- Since 2018, I have been trying to appreciate people around me more by telling them exactly what makes me respect/like them in the first place. Something specific like, "I appreciate how you're always answering my question with a thorough, detailed, and kind answer.", "I see how you're always taking care of people around you and how you're always remembering the first time/moment you meet them, what they said at that time, what they did.", "I admire how you're always trying to be professional, always striving to do your best, paying attention to your linkedin network and profile.". I know people don't usually say those kind of things in real life, not because they don't want to, but most of the times, because they forget to do so, or maybe because they're afraid people would find them weird, or creepy. I want them to know what a little bravery could do for their life and other people's life. A little appreciation goes a long way.
- I should really publish a book this year (2019). Self-publish is fine, but I need to produce something.

# Mantras
Words and statements I rephrase in my mind and tell myself every day. 
- __*"You don't know about that just yet."*__ - in terms of everything. [Epistemological Modesty](https://www.mbird.com/2011/04/volitional-and-epistemological-modesty-in-the-social-animal/) is the mantra.
- __*"Ask more, judge less."*__ - This is what I think when I hear a bad rumor about someone. I try to live by this rule: the first person that should know if I hate him/her is that person herself/himself. This way of thinking is inspired by my late father. Actually, this is his last wise words to me before he passed away: "Don't judge a person, Amanda. Whatever you think about a person, never judge a person.", but hey, you need to judge a person (at least, secretly) in life, so I revise it to my practical use. 
- __*"Life isn't cured. life is managed."*__ - in terms of depression and my anxiety disorder, I got it from the book "It's kind of a Funny Story" by Ned Vizzini.
- __*"It's probably just a bad day. Not a bad life."*__ - read the story of Ernest Hemingway's death. I could never see depression the same way anymore.
- __*"Be honest and be simple."*__ - when in love. 
- __*"My social norms and my surroundings should not dictate what and how I think. I think of anything I want to think about. Thank you."*__
- __*"I'm the writer. I'll tell people what they should think about. Not the other way around."*__ - in terms of writing
- __*"Let's just do it and cry/regret/sick about it later."*__ - when I need to take that leap of faith.
- __*"Don't get angry. Burn the bridges, sever the relationship, leave a person, but never be angry alone. If you're angry that much they should at least know that they have hurted you so much."*__
- __*"I never said that."*__ - me having fun, being amazed by almost everyone with their wild judgments about me.
- __*"It's scary. But we're bored, Amanda."*__ - when I need to do something out of my comfort zone =)) When talking to myself, I sometimes call myself in 'we' plural. Like, a team. There's a team of me that collaborate in order for me to survive this boring world. I don't know why but it soothes me. I don't feel so alone when I do that. 
- __*"Just punish them in silence."*__ - humans. they could be annoying. I got this from my best friend in university. We discussed about what's the point of expressing our anger to people when they usually just don't care about it. And she told me this: "Just punish them in silence, Mand. Don't do something significant, just enough to make yourself happy, like, slow responding their texts, or, stop calling them by their petnames (that you gave them), or distance yourself slowly without telling them so." It's mischievous, and maybe a bit coward in my part, but it fits my personality and it helps to control my mood and I could still maintain the harmony. So why not? 
- __*"Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves. Scheherezad-ie had a thousand tales. But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves. You got a brand of magic never fails"*__ - in terms of work. It's a lyric from the Aladdin's song: Friend Like Me. I feel happy when I could deliver the work goals. This is weird, but I usually posed myself as Aladdin's Genie that could do anything my master asked me to do. It's not easy to earn my respect, but once I did, I work with that kind of mentality. I think this is the very reason why I like Mike Ehrmantraut from Breaking Bad and Ser Davos Bravos from Game of Thrones. They don't fret, they don't fuss much about morals and such. They deliver the work. It's simple.

# Life Tips
- Listen to people's story, rephrase their words so they know you're listening, but open your mind for something they don't say. Those unsaid words reveals everything. **Learn about microexpression**, it's more effective than listening to human's words.
- Humans think they know about themselves, but they really are know nothing. Including us. **There's no use in putting so much hope in their promises, there's no use in trying to make promises**. Thank them for making the efforts, but don't see too much into it. Be kind and let them make mistakes. And if you like them enough, forgive their mishaps and keep them by your side. 
- **Everything changes**. People change. You change. Your environment changes. Memories fade. Health deteriorates. Relationship breaks. But on the other hand, something else blooms when another thing dies, death is necessary for something else to born into this world, for someone to grow, to learn new things. So instead of thinking too much about what you should do to preserve everything you have right now, try to enjoy the present moment instead. Don't let your fear of the unknown future and painful past prevent you from enjoying this little time that you have.
- Begging gets you nowhere. Fretting gives you nothing. **Take charge of your own life**, catch your own dreams. Don't wait for anybody to be angry/sad/happy for you, you can do that for yourself.
- Assume that good and evil exist, **we are all both good and evil**. There are no such thing as all-good person and all-evil person. We need those two to survive. Embrace your not-so-saint side. Talk with your demon, be friend with it. Remember Naruto and his kyuubi (ok. this sounds childish). Your demon is part of you, it's the embodiment of your anger, your sadness, your sorrow, and your pain. Learn how to cooperate with it, listen to its demands, know when it's triggered, and build your life around it. Don't hate it. Embrace it. Admit that the demon exists within you.
- When making a big decision, **give 4 months** to think before actually decide anything. Let most of your brain cells rebuild, let your body flushes out all the bad stuffs, toxic and maybe imbalance hormones, and think again. 
- When trying to forget someone, heal a severe broken heart, build a new version of self, **give yourself a solid 7 years timeline**.
- If you can't feel content of being alone with yourself, you should never blame others for not being able to make you content/happy.
- Stop trying to think that the goal of a relationship (whether is a friendship or romantic ones) is to fill an empty spot in your heart, try to fill other's instead. It's much easier that way.
- You can't share an empty cup. If you want to make someone else happy, you should prepare yourself first. Be happy with youself first.
- The best way to learn something is to let yourself feel stupid and vulnerable about it. You can't learn unless you admit that you know nothing about it.
- When learning something new, master the vocabularies first. Watch Catch Me If You Can.
- Social conventions and norms are boring and most of the times, toxic. Try to indulge people with it but don't let yourself be burdened by it.
- **You are what you eat.**
- E-book is as amazing as paperback. What matters is the story/content.
- Always know how to have fun. Always know when you are having fun. Mine would be when my hair is tangled and messy, no shoes in vicinitiy, cheeks hurting from too much smilling, and warm stomach. Know yours.
- Cook pasta like an Italian (that means: boil it as salty as the mediterannian sea), prepare sushi like a Japanese (fresh is the key), and always have your go-to recipe (mine would be fried vermicelli). **There's always a better way to do things in life**. Find it, execute it like a pro.
- Sing while cook.
- Life's too busy to have unreasonable goals. 
- Sleep for a minimum of 6 hours. Sleep before 11 pm every night. Get yourself a healthy dose of morning sun (between 6 to 8 am). Eat different kind of food every day to get all the nutritions you need. Reduce fat and oil, eat lots of boiled, grilled, and steamed food. Eat colorful food. Eat lots lots of fruit and vegetable. Drink a minimum of 2 litres of mineral water every day. 
- Invest in a healthy skin. Don't find a way to hide your age. Find a way to age gracefully.
- Always have a timeline. Always set a standard, even if it's related to feelings. Don't let your heart run (that) wild, always try to include logic in your decision. Worst case would be your brain can't control your feelings, and you're doomed for a heartache, but at least you've tried.

# Trivia
- A clown class, I love making people laugh with my (mostly) self-deprecating jokes.
- I prefer my hair tangled and messy. It reminds me of my beloved late grandmother (from my father side). I love so many things about my grandma, her curly hair-bun is one of my favorites.
- I don't like wearing wristwatch, bangle, short necklace, earrings, ring, and similar items. I can't focus when I'm wearing one (I could tolerate the long necklace though, I have several of those things). As an illustrator (or someone who loves to do illustration) I prefer my hands free from all of those things, including long nails. I always keep my nails short, and I don't wear nail polish, I still find it meaningless.
- I can't stand strong fragrance. I never bought a perfume in my whole life. I only have one kind of perfume (my sister bought it for me years ago), which still intact today. I only wear it (one mild spray!) when I'm going to important meeting with client, a wedding, or date =)). If I have to go to the hair saloon to cut my hair, I will have to bring my own shampoo, or I will have to rewash my hair by myself later when I'm home because I can't stand the smell of unfamiliar scent. It makes me dizzy and grumpy.
- In terms of friendship and fine things in life: quality over quantity. 
- My body can't tolerate coffee but I love the taste of mocha. Although I love to eat it, cauliflower makes my stomach hurt. I don't like soda. I am obssessed with custard puff.
- I'm a big fan of quotes. I collect it from everywhere, movie, music, and books. This is a very reason why I prefer ebook better than paperback, because I love to highlight almost every passages that I like in a book. Btw, here's my collection of quotes in Pinterest: https://id.pinterest.com/mandhut/quotes/
- Warm food/beverages, cold vacation places = my definition of a perfect holiday
- Mountain over beach. Eat porridge as it is, do not stir. Night drive is the best. So does roadtrip.
- If I like you, chances are, I wish I could stick a needle in your brain and see what happens next.
- My heart goes soft for Leonardo Dicaprio, I watch almost all of his movies. 
- I always have a thing with Japanese and its culture. 
- I trust my intuition (sometimes) too much. But like I always said, beat the machine all you want, the patterns are there.
- My kind of jokes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwYwnMuYizs, this is why I love Conan O' Brien. 
- And T.J. Miller https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf9N5AWprG8&t=194s, I watched this several times, laugh every time.

# Defined
I use several tools to help me (and others) understand myself. Here's my personal opinion about myself, and also the list and results of all the personality tests that I've taken, down to the horoscope and chinese zodiac ;)
- Always a child at heart, I do think that I'm suffered from a mild version of Peter-Pan syndrome. Growing up sucks. Paying bills sucks.
- I have anxiety disorder, I build my life around it, prepare myself for it, so I could retract and rejuvenate whenever the panic hits.
- MBTI Test: Once an ENFP (2005?), then an INFP (2010?), and now I am a proud INFJ (since 2015 if I'm not mistaken). According to mypersonality.info, I am 95% introvert, 84% intuitive, 58% Feeling, and 58% Judging, and I am more on the turbulence side, so I'm an INFJ-T ;).
- I fall into the range of hypersensitive person (HSP). I hate loud noises and bright lights. I especially hate white lights, I only use yellow lights in my room.
- Also, according to mypersonality.info, my 5 top personal intelligences are Musical (85 - but I'm not a musician, maybe I should become one), Logical (75), Intrapersonal (75), Visual (70) and Linguistic (65).
- 4-Personalities test: Once a Sanguine-Plegmatic (2004), not interested in re-taking the test.
- My IQ test results varied from 120 to 133? I guess I'm just so-so. I think my last IQ test is in 2004 (before I got into the university).
- Born in August 15th, 1986, I'm a lioness at heart (a leo, that also means I bestow the fire element in my soul - that's what they said) and I also born in the chinese year of the Fire Tiger. I am a canine in fire (that sounds wrong). I do love grilled meat, though, maybe that's why? ;)
